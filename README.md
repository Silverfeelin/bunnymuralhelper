# Animal Well: Bunny Mural Puzzle Helper

## Overview

The [Bunny Mural Puzzle Helper](https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/) is a tool designed to assist players in solving the Bunny Mural Puzzle in [Animal Well](https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/). It simplifies the process of piecing together the mural by providing a canvas where everyone can stitch together the final solution.

## Planned

- **Position Storage:** Thinking of storing the position data for the tiles in the users session cookie, it should do the trick for now.
- **Stitching Assistants:** As suggested by @mvp__ from the BIGMODE Official Discord Server: Adding coloring for the position indicators to show correctly / wrongly placed tiles / pieces.
